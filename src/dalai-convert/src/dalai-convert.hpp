     *  \section overview Overview
     *
     *  The _dalai-suite_ is part of the Eratosthene Project and is dedicated to
     *  3D models gathering, processing and format conversion. It allows to
     *  consider the most common formats and to convert them into the project
     *  common format. The _dalai-suite_ is mainly used for data gathering and
     *  processing, allowing to make them compatible with remote Eratosthene
     *  servers injection format.
     *
     *  In addition, the project common format allows to apply the _dalai-suite_
     *  solutions for 3D models processing. The suite offers solution for
     *  massive 3D models cleaning, hashing and assisted geographical
     *  registration. The suite also provides solution for 3D models display and
     *  analysis.

    /*! \brief main methods
     *
     *  The main function reads the input uv3 stream content and converts it
     *  in terms of its geographical coordinates. The result is exported in the
     *  output uv3 stream :
     *
     *      ./dalai-convert --input/-i [input file]
     *                      --output/-o [output file]
     *                      --from/-f --to/-t [conversion targets]
     *                      --geoid/-g [geoid file]
     *
     *  The main function starts by preparing the conversion by checking the
     *  conversion target and by reading the provided geoid.
     *
     *  The input file is then read and converted by chunks. The input stream
     *  converted chunks are then exported in the output stream.
     *
     *  Both input and output stream are expect to be in uv3 format containing
     *  direct coordinates.
     *
     *  The provided geoid has to be expressed in the correct coordinate frame
     *  according to the source target of the conversion.
     *
     *  \param  argc Standard parameter
     *  \param  argv Standard parameter
     *
     *  \return Returns standard exit code
