     *  \section overview Overview
     *
     *  The _dalai-suite_ is dedicated to the gathering and processing of
     *  geographical 3-dimensional information. It allows to considers the most
     *  common file formats and to convert them in a standardised and simple
     *  format.
     * 
     *  This standardised format allows to use the suite tools for color
     *  edition, model cleaning and model hashing. In addition, the standard
     *  format is also expected by the _eratosthene-suite_ implementing the EPFL
     *  CDH DHLAB indexation server and its geographical 3-dimensional data
     *  injection tools.

    /*! \brief color mapping methods
     *
     *  This function assigns a color to the provided color vector based on the
     *  provided height value. It starts by clamping the height value using the
     *  boundary values provided as parameters. The heights is then normalised
     *  on this interval and the color is computed following the implemented
     *  colormap.
     *
     *  \param dl_height Point height
     *  \param dl_data   Point color array
     *  \param dl_ledge  Height clamping range lower boundary
     *  \param dl_hedge  Height clamping range upper boundary

    /*! \brief main methods
     *
     *  The main function reads the vertex of the primitives of the provided uv3
     *  file and overrides their color through a mapping based on the vertex
     *  height :
     *
     *      ./dalai-color --input/-i [input file]
     *                    --output/-o [output file]
     *                    --minimum/-m [height low boundary]
     *                    --maximum/-x [height high boundary]
     *
     *  The resulting colored uv3 primitives are exported in the provided output
     *  stream.
     * 
     *  The vertex height is understood as the value stored by their third
     *  coordinates. If the third component is outside of the provided range, a
     *  cyclic condition is considered.
     *
     *  \param  argc Standard parameter
     *  \param  argv Standard parameter
     *
     *  \return Return standard exit code
