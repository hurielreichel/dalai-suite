     *  \section overview Overview
     *
     *  The _dalai-suite_ is part of the Eratosthene Project and is dedicated to
     *  3D models gathering, processing and format conversion. It allows to
     *  consider the most common formats and to convert them into the project
     *  common format. The _dalai-suite_ is mainly used for data gathering and
     *  processing, allowing to make them compatible with remote Eratosthene
     *  servers injection format.
     *
     *  In addition, the project common format allows to apply the _dalai-suite_
     *  solutions for 3D models processing. The suite offers solution for
     *  massive 3D models cleaning, hashing and assisted geographical
     *  registration. The suite also provides solution for 3D models display and
     *  analysis.

    /*! \brief main methods
     *
     *  The main function reads the content of the provided input uv3 stream and
     *  applies the provided translation on each respective dimension :
     *
     *      ./dalai-shift --input/-i [uv3 input file]
     *                    --output/-o [uv3 output file]
     *                    --x/-x [x-dimension shift]
     *                    --y/-y [y-dimension shift]
     *                    --z/-z [z-dimension shift]
     *
     *  The main function starts by opening both input and output streams before
     *  to read the input stream chunk by chunk. The provided shift values are
     *  then added to the respective coordinates of each record of each chunk.
     *
     *  The processed chunks are then exported one by one in the created output
     *  stream.
     *
     *  \param  argc Standard parameter
     *  \param  argv Standard parameter
     *
     *  \return Returns standard exit code
