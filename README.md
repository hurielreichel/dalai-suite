## Overview

The _dalai-suite_ is part of the Eratosthene Project and is dedicated to 3D models gathering, processing and format conversion. It allows to consider the most common formats and to convert them into the project common format. The _dalai-suite_ is mainly used for data gathering and processing, allowing to make them compatible with remote Eratosthene servers injection format.

In addition, the project common format allows to apply the _dalai-suite_ solutions for 3D models processing. The suite offers solution for massive 3D models cleaning, hashing and assisted geographical registration. The suite also provides solution for 3D models display and analysis.

## Suite Solutions

This section gives an overview of the tools available in the _dalai-suite_. Its purpose is to provide examples of the suite solutions applied on actual data.

In the first place, the _dalai-vision_ solution allows to read and display the content of the project common format. It allows to view models through a simple graphical interface to analyse point-based models, polygonal models and mixed models.
