## Overview

The _dalai-suite_ is part of the Eratosthene Project and is dedicated to 3D models gathering, processing and format conversion. It allows to consider the most common formats and to convert them into the project common format. The _dalai-suite_ is mainly used for data gathering and processing, allowing to make them compatible with remote Eratosthene servers injection format.

In addition, the project common format allows to apply the _dalai-suite_ solutions for 3D models processing. The suite offers solution for massive 3D models cleaning, hashing and assisted geographical registration. The suite also provides solution for 3D models display and analysis.

## Solutions Presentation

This section gives an overview of the tools available in the _dalai-suite_. Its purpose is to provide examples of the suite solutions applied on actual data.

In the first place, it allows the _dalai-vision_ solution to read and display the content of the project common format. It allows it to view models through a simple graphical interface in both case of point-based models :

and polygonal models as illustrated with models of the City of Geneva :

<br />

In addition to models visualization, the _dalai-vision_ also implements an assisted geographical registration tool mainly used for point-based models registration in a specific coordinate system. The tool allows the user to extrapolate surfaces of the models to allow the determination of precise intersections able to be used a control points during registration process :

<br />

Model filtering is also available through the _dalai-filter_ tool that allows to deduce clean representation of dense point-based models. It is especially adapted for dense models deduced from image sequences. The tool using the project common format and taking advantage of the model hashing, it allows to filter arbitrary large point-based models :

</p>
<br />

As a last illustration, the _suite_ also provides conversion tools allowing to bring data from standard format, such as polygon file format (PLY) and ASPRS (LAS) model, to the project common format. The conversion from LAS format allows to convert the element using their provided color, their classification or their intensities :

</p>
<br />

The _dalai-suite_ offer the required tools to collect, convert, process large amount of 3D data making them available for injection in remote Eratosthene servers.
