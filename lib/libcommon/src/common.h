     *  The _dalai-suite_ is designed to be a gathering and standardising
     *  interface to the geodetic system developed at the DHLAB of EPFL. It
     *  consists in a set of softwares having to convert any kind of geodetic
     *  data, mainly point clouds, into the defined universal format considered
     *  in the geodetic system. In other words, it is well described by its
     *  tibetan name.
