     *  \section overview Overview
     *
     *  The _dalai-suite_ is part of the Eratosthene Project and is dedicated to
     *  3D models gathering, processing and format conversion. It allows to
     *  consider the most common formats and to convert them into the project
     *  common format. The _dalai-suite_ is mainly used for data gathering and
     *  processing, allowing to make them compatible with remote Eratosthene
     *  servers injection format.
     *
     *  In addition, the project common format allows to apply the _dalai-suite_
     *  solutions for 3D models processing. The suite offers solution for
     *  massive 3D models cleaning, hashing and assisted geographical
     *  registration. The suite also provides solution for 3D models display and
     *  analysis.
