     *  \section overview Overview
     *
     *  The _dalai-suite_ is dedicated to the gathering and processing of
     *  geographical 3-dimensional information. It allows to considers the most
     *  common file formats and to convert them in a standardised and simple
     *  format.
     * 
     *  This standardised format allows to use the suite tools for color
     *  edition, model cleaning and model hashing. In addition, the standard
     *  format is also expected by the _eratosthene-suite_ implementing the EPFL
     *  CDH DHLAB indexation server and its geographical 3-dimensional data
     *  injection tools.
